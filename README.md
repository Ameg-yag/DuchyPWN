# EthTap
is an "anarchy" toolkit, that automatically wreaks havoc on the subnet it's connected on.
## Installation
Since this is a super malicious little thingy .. let's just say if you don't know how to install it, you probably shouldn't use it anyways. Just so you know, it's being tested on RPI3v2 with Rasbian Stretch and python 2.7 (cuz of scapy). Don't forget to run everything under the root account, since fcking up everything is it's purpose.
## DISCLAIMER
As always with projects of mine - IT'S MEANT PURELY FOR USE ON YOUR OWN NETWORKS AND USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK! I CLAIM NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THIS SOFTWARE!
## Bugs
The software itself is under light development and isn't by any means complete. I would be grateful for any pull requests you submit. Also feel free to hit me up with any errors you encounter - don't forget to include how to reproduce the issue.
