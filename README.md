# DuchyPWN
is an "anarchy" toolkit, that allows for deploying various Wi-Fi attacks.
## Installation
Since this is a super malicious little thingy .. let's just say if you don't know how to install it, you probably shouldn't use it anyways. Don't forget to run everything under the root account, since fcking up everything is it's purpose.
## DISCLAIMER
As always with projects of mine - IT'S MEANT PURELY FOR USE ON YOUR OWN NETWORKS AND USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK! I CLAIM NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THIS SOFTWARE!
## Usage
Run the main script at root of this repo.(`sudo python DuchyPWN.py`) It will automaticly load all the modules from modules folder. You can add your own or use mine. I'll be adding api API for performing various tasks as a one-liner. Rest of the usage will be on the wiki page. 
## Bugs
The software itself is under light development and isn't by any means complete. I would be grateful for any pull requests you submit. Also feel free to hit me up with any errors you encounter - don't forget to include how to reproduce the issue.
